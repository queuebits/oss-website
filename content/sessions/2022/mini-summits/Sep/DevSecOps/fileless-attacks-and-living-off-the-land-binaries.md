## About this session
"Fileless Attacks and “Living off the Land binaries” are attacks that don't use or leave any files behind, and happen in-memory: e.g., attacks using legitimate applications or processes in the environment. This panel will be a discussion on moving beyond focusing on the “known bad” (e.g., viruses, malware) and focusing on how to detect when legitimate tools behave abnormally and are being used to attack, how to respond and remediate, and how to mitigate: how to prevent legitimate tools from being used in attacks in the first place. Examples, real-world scenarios, and experiences will be explored.
